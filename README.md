# Employee Tracker
  
  ## Description
  - This project should let up store information on  departments, roles, and employees. It should also let us add additional departments, roles and employees. We should also be able to modify employee roles with a search of their first name. The bonus features of adding and removing was not added due to time contraints.
  - This project could help manage saleries, employees, and their roles for an individual looking to organize their employment information into one area.
